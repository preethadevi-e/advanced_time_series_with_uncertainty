📈 Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Uncertainty
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates multivariate time series forecasting using a deep learning model (LSTM) with uncertainty quantification. The model predicts multiple future time steps and estimates prediction uncertainty using Monte Carlo Dropout. The results are evaluated using error metrics and compared with a traditional statistical model (SARIMAX).

🧠 Key Features

LSTM-based deep learning model

Multi-step forecasting

Uncertainty estimation using Monte Carlo Dropout

80% and 95% prediction intervals

Coverage analysis for uncertainty evaluation

Baseline comparison using SARIMAX

Single-file, end-to-end implementation
